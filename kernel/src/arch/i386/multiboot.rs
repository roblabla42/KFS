//! Multiboot Information
//!
//! Gives access to the [multiboot information structure] created by our bootloader (GRUB).
//!
//! Bootloader (GRUB) passed its address in `$ebx` when we started.
//!
//! Our bootstrap had the job of copy-ing it to a PAGE_SIZE aligned address, map it,
//! and passed it to us in `$ebx`.
//!
//! When kernel initializes we store this address in [`BOOT_INFO`], and we can then access
//! it at any moment by calling [`get_boot_information`].
//!
//! [multiboot information structure]: https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot2/multiboot.html#Boot-information-format
//! [`BOOT_INFO`]: self::multiboot::BOOT_INFO
//! [`get_boot_information`]: self::multiboot::get_boot_information
